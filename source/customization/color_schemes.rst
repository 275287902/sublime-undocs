Color Schemes
=============

Sublime Text uses color schemes
to highlight source code
and to define the colors
of some items in the editing area:
background, foreground, gutter, caret, selection...

Color schemes are fully customizable.

Let's look at a Python file
as Sublime Text  highlights it
using the default color scheme:
