=========

To open the **search panel** for the active file, press ``Ctrl + F``. Some
options and actions available through this panel can be controlled from the
keyboard:

Toggle Regular Expressions	``Alt + R``
Toggle Case Sensitivity   	``Alt + C``
Toggle Exact Match       	``Alt + W``
Find Next					``Enter``
Find Previous				``Shift + Enter``
Find All					``Alt + Enter``
==========================	===========

.. _snr-incremental-search-buffer:

Incremental Search
==================

The **incremental search panel** is bound to ``Ctrl + I``. The only difference
with the regular search panel lies in the behavior of the ``Enter`` key: in
incremental searches, it will select the next match in the file and dismiss
the search panel for you. Choosing between this panel or the regular search
panel is mainly a matter of preference.
