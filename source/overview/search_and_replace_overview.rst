Regular Expressions
===================

Regular Expressions are a powerful tool to find text patterns in a document.
To take full advantage of the search and replace facilities in Sublime Text 2,
you should learn at least the basics of regular expressions.

Sublime Text 2 uses the `Boost syntax`_ for regular expressions.

.. _Boost syntax: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/perl_syntax.html 

To use regular expressions in the search panels,  you need activated them
first. The search term will otherwise be interpreted literally.
