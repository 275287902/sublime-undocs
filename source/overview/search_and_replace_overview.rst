Regular Expressions
===================

Regular Expressions are a powerful tool to find text patterns in a document.
To take full advantage of the search and replace facilities in Sublime Text 2,
you should learn at least the basics of regular expressions.

.. add link to syntax ref
Sublime Text 2 uses the Boost library syntax for regular expressions.

Regular expressions in the search panels need to be activated before use.
Otherwise you will perform a literal search.
