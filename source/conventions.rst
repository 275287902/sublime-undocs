About This Documentation
========================

This is the unofficial documentation for the Sublime Text editor, maintained by
volunteers. We hope it's useful!

Sublime Text 1 vs Sublime Text 2
================================

This documentation was initially written for Sublime Text 1. The second version
of the editor has brought about a few notable changes that render part of the
information in these pages inexact. For example, the settings format is now
JSON_, and the naming conventions for nearly everything conform to PEP8_, which
means that ``namesLikeThis`` look like ``names_like_this`` in Sublime Text 2.

.. _JSON: http://www.json.org/
.. _PEP8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

In the following weeks, we hope to bring the documentation in line with Sublime
Text 2. Until then, watch out for the differences between the two versions!


Conventions in This Guide
=========================

* This guide is written from the perspective of a Windows user, but most
  instructions should only require trivial changes to work on other platforms.

* Relative paths (e. g. :file:`Packages/User`) are rooted at the *data directory*
  unless otherwise noted. The *data directory* is explained in the
  :doc:`basic_concepts` section.

* We assume default key bindings when indicating keyboard shortcuts unless
  otherwise noted. Due to the way Sublime Text maps keys to commands, **some
  key bindings won't match your locale's keyboard layout**.

* This guide is in the process of being rewritten to target Sublime Text 2.
  Nevertheless, *mutatis mutandis*, most new information should be useful for
  Sublime Text 1 users too. Hey, that was Latin back there!
 
* *Sublime Text 2* is referred to simply as *Sublime Text* too (no pun
  intended).

Before you continue reading the material contained in this guide, we encourage
you to take a look at the :doc:`basic_concepts` section.

Happy learning!
