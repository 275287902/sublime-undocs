About this documentation
========================

.. Ask for contributions, point to issue tracker, etc.

This is the unofficial documentation for the Sublime Text editor, maintained by
volunteers. We hope it's useful!

Conventions
***********

* Relative paths (e. g. ``Packages\User``) are rooted at the parent of
  ``sublime.packagesPath()`` unless otherwise noted.

* We assume default key bindings when indicating keyboard shortcuts.
* This guide is being rewritten to target Sublime Text X specifically. Nevertheless,
  most new information should be useful for Sublime Text users too.
