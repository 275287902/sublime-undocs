About This Documentation
========================

This is the unofficial documentation for the Sublime Text editor, maintained by
volunteers. We hope it's useful!


Conventions in This Guide
=========================

* This guide is written from the perspective of a Windows user, but most
  instructions should only require trivial changes to work on other platforms.

* Relative paths (e. g. :file:`Packages/User`) are rooted at the *data directory*
  unless otherwise noted. The *data directory* is explained in the
  :doc:`basic_concepts` section.

* We assume default key bindings when indicating keyboard shortcuts unless
  otherwise noted. Due to the way Sublime Text maps keys to commands, **some
  key bindings won't match your locale's keyboard layout**.

Before you continue reading the material contained in this guide, we encourage
you to take a look at the :doc:`basic_concepts` section.

Happy learning!
